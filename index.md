# Welcome to My CS499 ePortfolio

This site showcases my CS499 projects.

This repository showcases two application projects developed during my Computer Science coursework and personal learning. Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to design software systems using appropriate algorithms, data structures, and modern programming practices, while solving real-world problems.

The projects focus on different but complementary aspects of software engineering: data persistence and safety, efficient data organization, and clean architectural design. One project emphasizes mobile application development and database integrity, while the other highlights algorithmic decision-making and data structure selection for managing complex relationships.

## 📱 Weight Tracking Android Application

The first project is an Android weight tracking application, originally developed in Java and later fully migrated to Kotlin. The app allows users to create an account, log in, or continue as a guest, and securely record weight entries that are permanently stored in a local SQLite database. Users can review their historical data to track progress over time and delete entries when needed.

### Key Features & Technologies:
- **Modern Android development** using Kotlin
- **Algorithms and data structures**, including controlled use of lists and immutability
- **Database design and persistence** with SQLite
- **Improved safety and reliability** through Kotlin's null-safety and read-only collection interfaces
- **Separation of concerns** between data storage, business logic, and UI

### Migration Benefits:
The migration from Java to Kotlin significantly improved the application's robustness, readability, and maintainability while reducing the risk of runtime errors and unintended data modification.

## 👥 Clientele Management Application

The second project is a clientele management application designed to manage clients, tasks, services, and appointments. This application focuses on efficient data access and organization using HashMaps to associate unique identifiers with domain objects.

### Key Features & Technologies:
Rather than relying on sequential searches through lists, this project uses HashMaps to:
- **Enforce unique identifiers** for clients, tasks, and appointments
- **Enable fast data retrieval** with constant-time average lookup
- **Model real-world relationships** between entities in a scalable way
- **Prevent duplicate or inconsistent** data entries

This project highlights my understanding of algorithmic efficiency, data modeling, and the practical trade-offs involved in selecting the right data structures for a given problem.

## 🎯 Purpose of These Projects

Together, these applications demonstrate my ability to:
- **Apply algorithms and data structures** to real software problems
- **Choose appropriate data structures** based on performance and design constraints
- **Write safer, more maintainable code** using modern language features
- **Design applications** that balance usability, integrity, and efficiency
